# FastFit Primitives (Blender Add-on)

⚠️ **Attention!**  
In **Blender 4.5** the addon may work incorrectly (primitives “jump” when changing settings in the Adjust Last Operation panel).  
This will be fixed in the **next update**.  
For stable work use Blender **4.0–4.4**.

**FastFit Primitives** is a free Blender add-on that allows you to quickly create primitives (cube or cylinder) that perfectly fit the bounding box of selected objects.  
It’s a handy tool for blockouts, collision meshes, or retopology.
